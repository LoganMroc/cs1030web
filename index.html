    <h1>Data Analysis Project</h1>
    
    <h2>Questions to be answered</h2>
    <ul><li>Who is the best regular season player based on average WAR in the NBA over the last 7 years?</li>
        <li>How many Star players, average players, and below average players have played in the NBA over the last 7 years based on Average WAR?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>WAR or WARP stands for Wins Above Replacement or Wins Above Replacement Player. It is a statistic that evaluates how many wins a certain player adds 
      to their team above a “replacement level player” or basically an average player. It is a fairly good indicator of how valuable a player is to their team.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Set Used</h2>
    <p>To figure this out I found a data set called modern_RAPTOR_by_player which contained statistics on 1093 different players from 2014 to 2020, including WAR during 
      the regular season, WAR during the playoffs, and WAR total which added the two previous statistics. To make it even I used WAR during the regular season since not 
      all teams make the playoffs and some play different games in the playoffs. In order to isolate the needed values, I consolidated my data and kept the player name, 
      player id, season year, and the WAR regular season statistic. </p>

    <h2>Data Analysis Process</h2>
    <p>I started by sorting the player ID in alphabetical order and then took the final season of each player and made a new column called name which is the same as 
      player_name without repeated values. I then took the average of every player’s WAR, using the =AVERAGE(), function for however many seasons they played and inserted 
      next to their name. While doing this I decided to apply a color code to sort the players into 5 different levels of play. Green represented a WAR of greater than 
      8 and was given the “Super Star“ player designation. From 4 to 8 a blue Star player designation was given. From 1 to 4 a yellow “Role” player designation was given. 
      From -1 to 1 a orange “Replacement” player designation was given. And for less than -1 a red “Below Average”  player designation was given. </p>

    <p>While I originally planned to do 3 levels, I noticed the difference between a player around 0 WAR and 3 WAR were very different in caliber of player, and 
      some players were of even higher caliber than the other Star players and deserved their own distinction.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f7S66iEQ6IBtY4TjjoIHSDjPP4lcWrBo-dhthDFgRZk/edit#gid=246891302">Link to edited data set</a></p>
    
    <p> I then filtered these averages to only show players above a 9.7 WAR. This allowed me to get the Top 10 Players in the NBA according to WAR from 2014-2020 and I chose 
      a bar graph to represent this data along with a table to show exact values.</p>
    
    <div id="img-div"> 
      <img id="image" src="Top 10 NBA Players 2014-2020 by Average WAR.png" alt= "Graph of the Top 10 NBA Players from 2014 to 2020 by Average WAR">
      <img src="Top 10 Players Table.png" alt= "Table showing the Top 10 NBA PLayers from 2014 to 2020 by Average WAR">
    </div>
    
    <p>After this I used google sheets COUNTIF and COUNTIFS functions to count the number of players within each of the ranges I previously designated. I once again chose 
      a bar graph to represent the data along with a table to show exact values. </p>
    
    <div id="img-div"> 
      <img id="image" src="Number of Players in Each Level of Play by Average WAR 2014-2020.png" alt= "Graph of the Number of Players in Each Level of Play by Average WAR 2014-2020">
      <img id="image" src="Level of play table.png" alt= "Table showing the Number of Players in Each Level of Play by Average WAR 2014-2020">
    </div>
    
    <h2>Thoughts on the Data</h2>
    <p>For the top 10 players by Average WAR, I was suprised by the reults. I thought Stephen Curry would take the top spot with Lebron following close in suit but James Harden
      managed to be the best player based of this valuable statistic. I believe for Stephen Curry this is because of his injury 5 games into the 2020 season. Because of this 
      injury he has a season close to 0 WAR as WAR is a cummulative stat that increases throughout the season, which makes sense because the more games you play the more wins
      you will be able to add to your team, so this brought his averages down a lot. For Lebron. I have no explanation. He is widely considered the best player in the league 
      and has been throughout the last couple of seasons, but other players just seem to be more valuable to their repsective teams. 
      
     <p>For the number of players in each level of play, I was also suprised. I never realized the number of players that have played over the last 7 years that are right at the
       level of a replacement player. 729 of the 1093 players are well, replaceable. Almost any NBA player can match their production. I was also suprised by the number of below 
       average players in the NBA despite it only being 29. If there are so many players in the league that can be an adequate player, that does very little to help but also 
       very little to hurt your team, why would you instead choose a player that statistically loses you games. The lowest value player at approximately -4 loses the team 4 more 
       games than if they didn't play him, so why play him at all. </p>
