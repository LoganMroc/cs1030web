    <h1>Data Analysis Project</h1>
    <h2>Questions to be answered</h2>
    <ul><li>Who is the best regular season player based on average WAR in the NBA over the last 7 years?</li>
        <li>How many Star players, average players, and below average players have played in the NBA over the last 7 years based on Average WAR?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>WAR or WARP stands for Wins Above Replacement or Wins Above Replacement Player. It is a statistic that evaluates how many wins a certain player adds 
      to their team above a “replacement level player” or basically an average player. It is a fairly good indicator of how valuable a player is to their team.</p>
